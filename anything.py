# Questions to Test Knowledge

# Variables and Data Types
"""1. True or False**: Variables in Python are case-sensitive.
2. Create a variable `age` and assign it the value `25`. Then, print `age`.
3. What is the data type of `height = 5.8`?"""

#answer
"""
1. True
2. 
  age = 25
    print("age")
3.integers 
"""





#Lists
"""
1. Create a list named `colors` with the values `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"`.
2. Add the color `"yellow"` to the list.
3. Print the second item in the `colors` list.
4. Remove `"green"` from the `colors` list and print the updated list.
"""

#answer
"""
1.
w, x, y = red, green, blue
print(w)
print(x)
print(y)

2.
w, x, y = red, green, blue, yellow
print(w)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

3.

# Dictionaries
"""
1. Create a dictionary named `car` with keys `make` (`"Toyota"`), `model` (`"Corolla"`), and `year` (`2020`).
2. Update the `year` to `2021`.
3. Add a new key `color` with the value `"blue"`.
4. Print the value associated with the key `model`.

#### Tuples
"""

1. Create a tuple named `dimensions` with values `1920` and `1080`.
2. Try changing the first value of the tuple to `1280`. What happens?
3. Explain why tuples might be used over lists.
"""
#answer
"""
1. dimensions = ("1920", "1080")
    print(dimensions)

2. syntax error

3.  Tuples have a defined order, and that order will not change,and allow duplicate values.

"""




#### Loops
"""
1. Write a `for` loop that prints each number from `1` to `5`.
2. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from `10` down to `1`.
3. Given the list `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write a loop that prints the square of each number.
"""
#answer
"""
1. numbers = ["1","2","3","4","5"]

2. numbers = 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

#### Combining Concepts
"""

1. Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student with keys `name` and `score`.
2. Write a loop to print each student's name and score.
3. Write an `if` statement to check if a student's score is above 70. If so, print `"{name} passed!"`, otherwise print `"{name} did not pass."`
